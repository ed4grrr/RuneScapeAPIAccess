## Introduction
Welcome to the Runescape API Accessor project! This project is my attempt at making a user-friendly and reliable
library for users to interact with the various RuneScape APIs. RASPIA abstracts the API communication from the user and
allows the user to simply request information from the API without creating their own API contacting code.

This project is meant to be used by anyone creating some Runescape 3 related program (THAT DOES NOT VIOLATE T&C and ToS).
The currently implemented code allows for a modest amount of information from the live game. These APIs are meant to be
"Everything-Included" style of programming. Each individual API Accessor class is wrapped with a decorator function that 
serves to parse the API response and return a standard python data structure for easier manipulation.

What's with the acronym? Well, I'm an idiot. I thought it sounded cool late one night. It took me a day or two to 
realize the acronym didn't match the order of the title. RASPIA sounds better than RSAPIA, but I am not opposed to using
either!

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RuneScapeAPIAccess.git
cd RuneScapeAPIAccess
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Using this package should take very little configuration for the pre-built API endpoints. The API classes are meant to
be all encompassing in use. Just instantiate an API class, give it the required arguments, and receive a list or a dict
containing the request information (assuming the API endpoints are currently functioning).
